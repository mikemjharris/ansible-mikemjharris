## Ansiblie mikemjharris

www.mikemjharris.com currently consists of nginx routing to a number of webapps.  This is currently sustained by some bash scripts, custom nginx config and some spit and prayers.  This repo is an attempt to move that config into a reproducable environment.  Yes it's ansible which is really just a nice wrapper around the aforementioned bash scripts but hey, it's easier to read and easier to maintain in source control.
